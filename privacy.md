            <h3>a) Image Data (Photos from Camera or Gallery)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>How it's collected:</strong> The App captures photos using your device's camera or allows you to select images from your device's gallery when you choose to use the image classification feature.</li>

                <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To provide you with an AI-powered classification or rating related to the content of the image.</li>
                <li><strong>Storage & Retention:</strong> Images are <strong>not</strong> permanently stored on your device or our servers. They are used only for the immediate classification request and then discarded.</li>
                <li><strong>Legal Basis for Processing:</strong> Your explicit <strong>consent</strong>. You are required to acknowledge this Privacy Policy before accessing camera functionalities for the first time.</li>

                <li><strong>Legal Basis for Processing:</strong> Our <strong>legitimate interest</strong> in providing a user-friendly and accessible experience, and your implied consent when selecting a language.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>c) API Usage Tracking Data (for Rate Limiting)</h3>
            <ul>
                 <li><strong>How it's collected:</strong> Automatically tracked when you use the image classification feature.</li>
                 <li><strong>What is collected:</strong> A counter for API requests made within a minute(a day) and the timestamp of the first request in that minute (day).</li>
                 <li><strong>Storage:</strong> This data is stored locally on your device.</li>
                 <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To manage API usage and prevent abuse of the service by applying rate limits.</li>
                 <li><strong>Retention:</strong> This data is automatically reset when the respective time periods (minute or day) expire.</li>
                 <li><strong>Legal Basis for Processing:</strong> Our <strong>legitimate interest</strong> in maintaining the stability, security, and fair use of our service and the third-party API.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. How We Use Your Information</h2>
            <p>We use the collected information solely for the following purposes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>To provide App functionality:</strong> Classifying images as requested by you and displaying the App in your chosen language.</li>
                <li><strong>To maintain and protect our services:</strong> Implementing rate limits to ensure service availability and prevent abuse.</li>
                <li><strong>To comply with legal obligations.</strong></li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>5. Data Sharing and Third Parties</h2>
            <h3>a) Google's AI API</h3>
            <p>To provide the image classification feature, we send compressed image data you provide to Google's AI API.</p>
            <p><strong>Important Considerations:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>No other personal identifiers are sent with these requests.</strong> We do not send your IP address, device identifiers, or any other personal information to Google's AI API through our App, beyond the image.</li>
                <li>Google acts as a <strong>data processor</strong> for this information, meaning they process the data on our behalf and according to our instructions (and their own terms of service and privacy policies for the AI API).</li>
                <li>We encourage you to review Google's own privacy policies to understand how they handle data.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>b) Other Third Parties</h3>
            <p>We do not share your personal data with any other third parties, except as required by law.</p>
            
            <h2>6. Data We DO NOT Collect</h2>
            <p>We are committed to data minimization. EcoSort.Barcelona <strong>does not</strong> collect:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Personal identifiers (e.g., name, email address, physical address beyond what you might voluntarily provide for contact).</li>
                <li>User accounts (you can use the App without creating an account).</li>
                <li>Precise location data (GPS).</li>
                <li>Device identifiers (e.g., IMEI, MAC address).</li>
                <li>Detailed analytics or usage patterns beyond the aggregated API rate limiting counts.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
            <p>We retain your data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Image Data:</strong> Not stored. Processed ephemerally for each request.</li>
                <li><strong>Language Preference:</strong> Stored on your device until you change it or clear app data.</li>
                <li><strong>API Usage Tracking Data:</strong> Automatically reset after the defined time period (minute/day) expires.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>8. Data Security</h2>
            <p>We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect the information we handle. Image processing (resizing, compression) happens on your device before any data is sent externally. However, please remember that no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.</p>

            <h2>9. Data Processing Location</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>On-Device Processing:</strong> Image resizing and compression, language preference storage, and API rate limit tracking occur on your device.</li>
                <li><strong>External Processing:</strong> AI-based image classification is performed by Google's AI, which means the image data and prompt are processed on Google's servers. These servers may be located outside of your country of residence.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>10. International Data Transfers</h2>
            <p>When you use the image classification feature, your image data are transferred to Google's servers, which may be located in countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA). Google employs measures like Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) to ensure that such transfers comply with GDPR requirements for data protection.</p>

            <h2>11. Your Rights Under GDPR</h2>
            <p>As a user in the European Union, you have the following rights regarding your personal data:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The right to be informed:</strong> To know how your data is being processed (which this Policy aims to do).</li>

                <li><strong>The right to restrict processing:</strong> To request the limitation of how we use your data, under certain conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>The right to data portability:</strong> To receive your data in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format and to transmit it to another controller, under certain conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>The right to object:</strong> To object to the processing of your data, under certain conditions (e.g., for direct marketing, or processing based on legitimate interests).</li>
                <li><strong>Rights related to automated decision-making and profiling:</strong> You have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning you or similarly significantly affects you, except under certain conditions. (While our AI classification provides a rating, it should not produce legal or similarly significant effects without human oversight).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To exercise any of these rights, please contact us at the email address provided in Section 2. We will respond to your request within one month, as required by GDPR.</p>
