            <ul>

                <li>sharing a Pro account across multiple users or organizations.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Local regulations vary by municipality, region, and country. You are solely responsible for ensuring proper waste disposal in accordance with local laws.</strong></p>

            <p><strong>The Company is not responsible for any fines, penalties, sanctions, or damages resulting from incorrect sorting, disposal actions, or reliance on the App’s suggestions.</strong></p>

            <p>All content, software, designs, trademarks, and algorithms in the App belong to the Company or its licensors. You may not copy, distribute, or create derivative works from the App without written permission.</p>

            <h2>12. Termination</h2>
            <p>The Company may suspend or terminate your access at any time for violating these Terms or engaging in abusive behavior.</p>
